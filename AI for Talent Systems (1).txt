“Context is king for AI agents. Which means that there’s going to be a huge premium for the individuals, teams, and companies that are able to best design systems to give agents the best context to do their work. 

Knowledge work has always been a relatively messy space. If you go into most companies, documentation is often out of date, lots of learnings come just through osmosis internally, and best practices are generally ineffectively shared at scale.

AI agents flip this on its head. The leverage you get from agents is how effectively you can get agents the appropriate data to do their work, with well structured goals, a deep understanding of your workflows, and the practices of your team or company.

Most of this just isn’t written down today or kept up to date. We’re going to see all new levels of emphasis put on documenting everything important about work, and keeping that current in sync across teams. 

And this is going to matter more than ever as AI agents scale from being for individual productivity to being for teams or entire companies.” - Box CEO Aaron Levie

If there’s one thing that you take away from this deck, let it be that without proper context, your AI systems will not work 

Single Player vs Multiplayer AI
Single Player

These are your basic chat models, and is in reference to employees engaging with tools like ChatGPT, Claude, & Gemini to get their work done. 

This is an incredibly important aspect of AI adoption across Talent Systems, but it is not what the primary focus of this deck is. 

My recommendation for Single Player AI is to 

Provide access to ChatGPT Enterprise / Gemini / or Claude Teams across the organization. 
Provide continuous training, demos, & insights that enable employees to get their work done more efficiently. 
Create communication channels to highlight wins and encourage continuous experimentation. 
Multiplayer AI

These systems, known as Automations, AI Automations, or AI Agents, enable teams to take current manual processes (often done across multiple employees or across departments) and scale them or augment them with AI actions. 

Most recommendations in this deck will fall under the camp of Multiplayer AI. This is because at the current time, it’s more valuable to have a dedicated individual build and deploy a Multiplayer AI system, than to have a individual teams do it. 

Necessary to understand current processes and pain points. 
Necessary to have technical knowledge and know how to build automations and agents with advanced prompts, API connections, and proper evaluation frameworks.

An AI Agent is an AI system that, when given a goal or objective, can use a set of tools to achieve that goal, and it will keep working until the job is done.
Currently, this is best exemplified by software development agents within Cursor or Claude Code. Software developers work hard to provide specs, context, and prompts (the upfront goals), and the agents create and deploy working applications. This same model is quickly moving from within the realm of software engineering, and towards all aspects of knowledge work. 
Every ~4 months, new foundational model launches enable new capabilities for AI Agents. E.G. computer use agents are beginning to be deployed but are currently too slow and expensive to be used at scale. This could change with the next foundational model release, impacting how we think about certain workflows.   
The best way to plan for this future is to adopt a culture of continuous experimentation and innovation, with the lowest friction possible. One way to ensure that friction is low, is to always have proper context available to AI systems; and we’re going to talk about that a lot in this deck. 

AI Agents, what they are, why they matter now, and where we’re going

The Problem
Most companies start with "What AI tools can we implement?" instead of "What business problems need solving?"
As a result, they end up deploying disconnected pilot projects with little integration strategy. 
They optimize for short term ROI instead of building sustainable foundations. 
The Solution
Before recommending any technology, understand workflows and where time is spent. 
Identify manual bottlenecks (e.g., 1-3 week data requests, 5-day approval cycles)
Fix data and process issues before adding AI or new toolsets
And measure what matters - focus on time saved, decisions accelerated, and capacity unlocked

But First.. Why AI Initiatives Fail

Are we increasing marketplace velocity?
Time from job posting to application. 
Number of jobs posted, number of new casting directors/agents/agencies onboarded, time from onboarding to posting first job. 
Number of actors onboarded, time from onboarding to application of first job, number of jobs applied to. 
Are we increasing marketing or sales velocity? 
Lead response time, campaign launch time, cost per acquisition
Are we increasing product or development velocity? 
Feature deployment cycle (goal is 2-3 times per week) 
Are we enabling enhanced strategic decision making? 
Qualitative - are we using platform data to make decisions vs. ‘vibes’ 
Are we offloading overtly manual tasks?
Rate of process automation for previously manual tasks 
Are we increasing employee efficiency & enjoyment?  
Qualitative - based on HR, surveys, feedback, etc.

Data
The Building Block For AI Success
02


AI models require proper context from ALL three data types to deliver optimal value. Each domain demands a distinct extraction and preparation strategy.

Context is Key
Platform Data

Structured transactional data from 7 platforms covering user behavior, transaction histories, and system performance.
Current State: Siloed, limited cataloging, bottlenecked access.
1
Unstructured Data

Documents and communications across enterprise tools, including Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, meeting notes, Jira, and email threads.
Current State: Scattered, no unified search, context lost in silos.
2
Tacit Knowledge

Critical information stored in employee expertise, covering undocumented processes and historical decision rationale.
Current State: Inaccessible, lost when employees leave, no capture mechanism.
3

Four Steps to Provide Context to AI Agents

Well documented processes

Data that is set up to actually get to an agent easily

Hyper precise goals and prompts

Mindset that the human in the loop element is not being involved in every single step of an agent, but editing and reviewing its final output.

Addressing data infrastructure requires implementing quick wins to build AI momentum, enabling more advanced opportunities
Data | Overview
To enable company wide instant access to platform data insights, natural language querying of data, and a foundation of context that AI Agents can use, Talent Systems must first properly catalog platform data. 
Easily accessible, accurate data. 

Proper tagging and cataloging of platform events
Department Goals
Key Takeaways
A third party Snowflake consultant can help to expedite proper data cataloging across platforms. 

Once completed, implementation of Snowflake Cortex (semantic model on top of data) and less reliance on Qlik is possible. 

The biggest opportunity in the next five years relies on AI Agents to be fed proper context from platform data. The High-Value Job Campaign Agent is a prime example of this.

Reducing data requests from 1-3 weeks to instant unlocks the greatest productivity opportunity within the organization and enables a majority of further AI recommendations.  
Proper Cataloging of Platform Data & Unlocking Snowflake Cortex
Currently
With AI
Little documentation of what data exists across 7 platform databases, leading to data requests that take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Platform data insights are bottlenecked by the amount of available data engineers. 

Lacking a unified definition of basic business terms (e.g. “subscriber” has different meanings across different platforms) 

Automation opportunities are limited due to the manual nature of requesting insights and pulling new requests. 

   
Once properly cataloged, data insights can be accessed via a semantic model (Snowflake Cortex) 
Removes analysis bottleneck and turns the entire company into data analysts 
Reduces data request turnaround time from 1-3 weeks to instant

Enterprise knowledge search and project/department specific AI Assistants are reliant on properly structured unstructured data 
Structuring Unstructured Data for use by AI
Currently
Three Step Process 
Documentation is scattered across 5+ systems (Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Jira, shared drives). Across industries, McKinsey reports that upwards of 30% of knowledge workers time is spent simply looking for the correct answer, SOP, or documentation. In my discovery interviews, this seems consistent within departments at Talent Systems. Important information is not documented, and instead lives in key employees heads.

The Glean trial showed conflicting reports of usefulness, due to the AI’s inability to differentiate between contradictory or outdated information. 
   
There is a three step process per department to enable faster knowledge retrieval and provide proper context to AI systems. 

Curate High-Impact Knowledge, think SOPs, decision trees, FAQs, rubrics, and process documentation. 
Establish Governance & Ownership by knowledge area and within rules for AI systems (e.g. must cite sources)
Implement Structured Ingestion Process for enterprise knowledge search, providing context to AI, and ingesting new content 

Tip: Enable employees to create new SOPs with Scribe
70% reduction in search time per employee.  Estimated 8-12 hrs per week reduced to 2-3.  
95% reduction in AI hallucinations via authoritative grounding
Unstructured Data Management

Autonomous AI Data Analysts enable a new form of AI powered executive dashboard, getting ahead of what happened, why, and response suggestions
AI Powered Executive Dashboard
Currently
Automated Data Analysis
Executives at Talent Systems are hamstrung due to lack of on-demand data analysis, impacting high level strategic decisions, marketing optimization, financial reporting, product roadmaps, and more. 
   
Data analysis changes from by request → to on demand → to autonomous and predictive. 

AI Agents constantly analyze key data points within platform metrics, surfacing anomalies, new trends, and insights. Using toolsets, these agents can understand what happened, why it’s happened, and provide immediate recommendations on what responses to take. 

The ultimate AI powered executive dashboard.

AI-Powered Business Verification for Customer Onboarding
Currently
With AI
Customer Success teams manually verify each new casting director, agency, and production company through time-intensive research and reference checking.

Manual process includes searching company websites, validating business licenses, checking industry references, and verifying production credits - taking 30-45 minutes per customer.

Inconsistent verification approaches across team members create risk of both approving fraudulent accounts and rejecting legitimate businesses due to incomplete research.
AI automates the manual research steps using business intelligence APIs and industry databases for instant verification with consistent standards.

Connecting platform usage data to HubSpot enables automated insights, proactive outreach, and predictive account management
Intelligent CRM Automation Powered by Platform Data Integration
Currently
With AI
Sales and Customer Success teams work in HubSpot but lack visibility into actual platform usage, job posting patterns, and engagement metrics.

Manual checking across systems to understand if customers are posting jobs, how many submissions they're receiving, or if usage is declining.

Reactive approach to churn and expansion - only discovering opportunities after customers explicitly request changes or cancel.
Platform data automatically flows into HubSpot, triggering intelligent workflows and recommendations based on customer behavior.

AI agents analyze usage patterns and automatically:
Update CRM records with latest activity
Generate follow-up tasks when usage drops
Alert to churn risk before cancellation
Create personalized outreach based on behavior

AI Agents can be programmed to exactly mimic current manual research processes

   
Ultimately, this is the North Star but proper usage of AI Automation in HubSpot can be implemented on a rolling timeline. 

Requires implementation on a case by case basis.

Capturing new signups through AEO/GEO requires content strategy shift and independent publication presence
Building Trust with LLMs Through External Domain Authority
Currently
With AI - AEO Implementation Plan
Talent Systems platforms appears sparsely in ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini responses about casting platforms, missing critical discovery moments when users ask "best casting platform" or "how to submit to casting calls."

There is a lot of experimentation and investment, but no systematic approach to AEO. There is currently a lack of best practices in the industry, which means experimentation is key.

All content lives on company domains (talentsystems.com, castingnetworks.com), which LLMs treat as potentially biased sources, reducing citation frequency compared to third-party publications.
Deploy systematic AEO strategy using proven tactics from companies like WebFlow while enabling a culture of experimentation..

Phase 1: Foundation 
Transform paid search keywords into questions using LLMs
Deploy AEO tracking tools to monitor answer share
Create ‘The Casting Journal’ - independent publication for external authority 

Phase 2: Content Strategy 
YouTube videos for B2B terms like “casting platform comparison” - few videos exist for non-glamorous industry terms 
Reddit strategy with transparent Talent Systems affiliation providing useful answers
Help center optimization for follow-up questions about features and integrations

AI development tools enable marketers to create custom software as content, moving beyond newsletters and videos to interactive value delivery
Building Functional Tools as Marketing Assets
Currently
With AI - Software Content Strategy
Traditionally, marketing content has been limited to formats like: blog posts, newsletters, podcasts, videos, social posts, and campaigns.

Audience engagement requires passive consumption rather than active utility, limiting value delivery and memorability.

There is a technical barrier that prevents marketers from creating software tools, requiring engineering resources for any interactive content. 

This technical barrier is rapidly decreasing, and enabling a new skill set for marketers.
Using Lovable, Replit, Bolt, and Claude Code, marketers can build functional tools that provide immediate value to users.

Example Tools for Talent Systems 
Headshot Quality Checker - AI tool analyzing photos
Audition Prep Timer - Practice session manager 
Role Match Calculator - Compatibility scorer

Each tool drives organic sharing, backlinks, and brand awareness while providing genuine utility.




   
No Engineering Needed Marketers build directly

To accelerate from 2-4 week cycles to daily releases, we must transform three parallel workstreams: Product standardization with AI-enhanced PRDs, Development evolution to AI-native practices, and QA automation from manual to intelligent testing.
Product: Centralized docs, standardized PRDs, real-time data access

Development: AI-native coding

QA: Automated test generation, 3-hour regression cycles
Department Goals
Key Takeaways
Internal audit identified 240 hours/quarter savings (10% capacity gain) through better process documentation and standardization.

Current 2-4 week deployment cycles blocked by 3-5 day manual regression testing - industry standard is daily releases.

Modern development teams write only 15-20% of code manually, but organization lacks AI-native development tools and training.

Core automation opportunities exist within Jira and Confluence workflows to eliminate repetitive manual tasks.

Creating a single source of truth saves 1.5-3 hours per sprint while enabling AI tools to understand product context
Quick Win: Unified Product Knowledge Base
Currently
Centralized Product Hub
Bron's audit: "Docs live across Slack, Confluence, shared drives, and DMs" causing teams to "often redo work that already exists."

"Trying to remember the name of someone else's document can be a labyrinth" - hours lost searching for specs and decisions.

Critical context buried in private Slack threads, forgotten Google Docs, and scattered email chains.
Create Confluence hub with standardized structure enabling both human and AI navigation.

Implementation (Month 1):
Single landing page per product area
Standardized naming conventions
Template library for PRDs, decisions, research
Slack integration to capture key discussions
AI-searchable tags for Glean/ChatGPT
Weekly audit to maintain organization

One Location Everything Findable
3/hrs per sprint saved

Centralized Product Documentation Hub

Enhanced PRD templates with edge case documentation prevent 1.5-2 hours of designer rework per sprint
Quick Win: Comprehensive Requirement Templates
Currently
Enhanced PRD Standard
No consistent PRD format across PMs - "everyone has efficient way but no consistent approach."

Bron found "missed edge cases get overlooked" causing "the most back-and-forth" between design and development.

"A business delay just before go-live is the most common problem" due to unclear launch criteria.
Implement company-wide PRD template with built-in edge case tables and launch readiness criteria.

Template Components:
Edge case table with conditional behaviors
Launch readiness checklist (go/no-go gates)
Change control process for scope management
Acceptance criteria pre-written for QA
AI research summaries for competitive analysis
V0/Lovable prototype links

Along with standardized templates, AI research and prototyping tools enable PMs to gain competitive understanding, inspiration, and visualize their ideas such that prototypes become the source of truth. 
Consistent Format All PMs aligned
Fewer Surprises Edge cases covered
Clear Launch Path No last-minute delays
Enhanced PRD Templates

Automating repetitive workflows saves TPMs 3.5-7 hours per sprint while improving accuracy
Quick Win: Comprehensive Requirement Templates
Currently
Automated Workflows
TPMs manually update 50+ tickets - "Manually updating over 50 tickets is a major pain point."

Weather updates require manual scanning - "It's all in Jira but I have to piece it together manually."

Risk logs recreated from scratch every sprint across scattered tools.
Bron’s audit revealed TPMs spend excessive time on release tagging (manually updating 50+ tickets), status reporting (recreating weather updates from scattered Jira data), and risk management (rebuilding same tables every sprint). These are perfect candidates for automation rules.

Implementation Approach:
Release management automation - Auto-tag fixVersion when tickets move to QA/merge, eliminating manual bulk updates
Live reporting dashboards - Embedded Jira tables in Confluence that update automatically, replacing manual weather report compilation
Unified risk tracking - Centralized dashboard with RAG indicators pulling from standardized fields
Smart notifications - Automated alerts for blockers, dependencies, and status changes
Bulk operations - Mass ticket updates triggered by workflow events
Zero Manual Work Set it and forget it
Live Visibility Always current
7 hrs/sprint freed TPM focus on strategy

Automating test case creation eliminates manual writing of 6-8 cases per ticket
Quick Win: Requirements to Test Cases
Currently
Automated Workflows
QA manually writes 6-8 test cases per ticket - "they're having to write manually in TestRail, and that takes time."

Team "cutting corners in test planning because of Sprint demands" leading to escaped bugs.

Always "catching up with developer changes" - only finding issues at Sprint end.
Deploy AI Agent integration that converts requirements directly into executable test cases.
